> Orthogonal Vectors

* The word orthogonal means exactly the same thing as perpendicular, and it is the word that is usually used in linear algebra.

* Two vectors are orthogonal if and only if Mod(a)^2 + Mod(b)^2 = Mod(a+b)^2.


> Multiplying a Bra by a ket

* If we have a bra and a ket of the same dimension, we can multiply them—
the bra on the left and the ket on the right—to obtain a number.

* This becomes bracket by concatenating two names on multiplication. 

* It is denoted by <a|b>.

> Ordered Basis

* An ordered basis is a basis in which the vectors have been given an order, that is, there is a first vector, a second vector, and so on.

* If { |b1> , |b2> ,..., |bn> } is a basis, we will denote the ordered basis by ( |b1>, |b2>,..., |bn> ) — we change the brackets from curly to round.

* Two sets are equal if they have the same
elements—the order of the elements does not matter

* For an ordered basis the order the basis vectors are given matters.

* The first vector in the ordered basis on the left is not equal to the first vector in the ordered basis on the right, so the two ordered
bases are distinct.
